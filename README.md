- ⚡ Fun fact:Did you know that the first computer virus was created in 1983? Named the "Elk Cloner" and developed by 15-year-old Richard Skrenta, it spread to other computers by hiding in the boot sector of floppy disks. This virus wasn't malicious; it simply displayed a poem on the infected computers' screens.
